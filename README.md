Sprout Exam Web Application

Question:

If we are going to deploy this on production, what do you think is the next
improvement that you will prioritize next? This can be a feature, a tech debt, or
an architectural design.

Answer:

For frontend I think we can migrate to react hooks for any future front end changes.
For backend I think we can add Dapper as ORM so we could optimize the usage of native SQL queries easily, specially in database read use cases.
